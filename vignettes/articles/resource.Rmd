This resource was established by analyzing several reference ATAC-seq dataset. It includes analysis reports that were generated by `ChrAccR`. These reports can be used to familiarize oneself with the output of `ChrAccR` and to explore the analyzed datasets.

## ATAC-seq atlas of sorted immune cell populations
Analysis of sorted immune cells from the B and T cell lineages. The dataset includes ATAC-seq profiles of 142 samples in a naive or an immune-stimulated state. A study providing the dataset and an in-depth analysis has been previously published in Nature Genetics [@Calderon:2019cb].

## Human hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution
Analysis of normal human hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution. The dataset comprises 31,894 cells derived from bone marrow and PBMC samples. A study providing the dataset and an in-depth analysis in the context of childhood leukemia has been previously published in Nature Biotechnology [@Granja:nbt:2019].
